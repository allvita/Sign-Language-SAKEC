Process Flow 
Initialization:User opens the application and logs in or registers.
Input Capture:User performs sign language gestures in front of the camera.                The camera captures the video frames.
Pre-processing:Frames are filtered and prepared for analysis (e.g., background removal, normalization).
Feature Extraction:Key features of the gestures are extracted using computer vision techniques.
Gesture Recognition:Extracted features are processed by a machine learning model.The model classifies the gestures into predefined categories.
Translation:Recognized gestures are mapped to corresponding text or spoken language.
Technologies used
Keras: High-level neural networks API for building and training deep learning models.
HTML: Markup language for structuring web content.
CSS: Stylesheet language for designing web page
Pycaw: Python library for controlling Windows audio mixer.

Conclusion
The sign language interpreter project leverages a combination of advanced technologies including Keras, HTML, CSS, Pycaw, OpenCV, scikit-learn, and TensorBoard. These tools work together to create a robust application that captures gestures, processes them using deep learning, and provides real-time translation. This innovative approach not only enhances communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community but also showcases the potential of integrating machine learning with real-world applications. The project is a testament to how technology can bridge gaps and make a meaningful impact.
