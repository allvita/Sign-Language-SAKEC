 Sign Language Interpreter

Features Offered
Real-Time Translation:
The application offers real-time translation of sign language gestures into text or spoken language, facilitating seamless communication between sign language users and non-users.
High Accuracy Recognition:
Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, the interpreter ensures high accuracy in recognizing and interpreting various sign language gestures
User-Friendly Interface:
The application boasts an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, making it accessible for users of all ages and technical backgrounds.
Real-Time Feedback:
Provides immediate feedback to users on the accuracy of recognized gestures, helping them refine their sign language communication skills.
Multi-Language Support:
The interpreter supports multiple spoken languages, allowing translations from sign language to various target languages based on user preference.
Process Flow 
Initialization:User opens the application and logs in or registers.
Input Capture:User performs sign language gestures in front of the camera.                The camera captures the video frames.
Pre-processing:Frames are filtered and prepared for analysis (e.g., background removal, normalization).
Feature Extraction:Key features of the gestures are extracted using computer vision techniques.
Gesture Recognition:Extracted features are processed by a machine learning model.The model classifies the gestures into predefined categories.
Translation:Recognized gestures are mapped to corresponding text or spoken language.
